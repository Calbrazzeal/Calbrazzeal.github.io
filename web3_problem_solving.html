        <br>
        Web 3 is trying to solve a lot of problems with the Internet of today the problem with Internet now is that
        there's too much power in the hands of too few companies and web 3 aims to distribute that power to the
        community it's more open source and more distributed it aims to solve problems with privacy where we own our own
        data instead of companies owning it.
