        Web 3 is trying to solve a lot of problems with the Internet of today the problem with Internet now is that
        there's too much power in the hands of too few companies and web 3 aims to distribute that power to the
        community it's more open source and more distributed it aims to solve problems with privacy where we own our own
        data instead of companies owning it.
        Web3 is the next generation of the internet, powered by blockchain and decentralized technologies. It offers new
        opportunities for developers, entrepreneurs, and innovators who want to create and use applications that are
        more secure, transparent, and fair. Web3 is trying to solve some of the fundamental problems that Web2 presents,
        such as:

        Content rights: Web2 platforms often take away the ownership and control of content creators, who have to rely
        on intermediaries or centralized services to monetize their work. Web3 platforms aim to restore the rights of
        content creators, who can directly own and distribute their content using smart contracts and tokens12.
        Security: Web2 platforms are vulnerable to hacking, censorship, manipulation, and data breaches. Web3 platforms
        use cryptography and consensus mechanisms to ensure the integrity and immutability of data and transactions.
        Web3 platforms also enable users to have more privacy and anonymity by using encryption and pseudonyms12.
        Incentive economy: Web2 platforms often exploit the usersâ€™ attention and data for profit, without giving them
        any value or reward. Web3 platforms aim to create a fairer and more democratic incentive economy, where users
        can earn tokens for their participation and contribution. These tokens can be used to access services or
        products on the platform or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies13.
